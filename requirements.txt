Can you produce a draft non material change memo that includes a few sections. 
The first section should be with relation to the property overview and investment summary in the LP memo. 
The next section should include the changes mentioned in the Email template, and should be included in the non material 
change memo as a section unto itself. Then there should be a section that covers any changes noticed between the November and 
August 2024 Personal Financial Statements, i.e., change to net worth of the person submitting the forms. 
You can use the uploaded example non-material change memo as the basis for the draft that I require


^^ functioning instructions for the prompt
